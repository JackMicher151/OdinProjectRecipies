        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon dried dill</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>3 cups vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3> Directions </h3>
        <p> 
            <ol>
                <li>Place potatoes in a Dutch oven and cover with cold salted water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until parboiled, about 6-7 minutes; drain well and let cool. </li>
                <li>Using a box grater, finely shred potatoes. Using a clean dish towel or cheese cloth, drain potatoes completely, removing as much water as possible. </li>
                <li>Transfer potatoes to a large bowl. Stir in flour, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and dill; season with salt and pepper, to taste. The mixture should be workable but dry. Form potatoes into tots. </li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium high heat until it registers 360 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, add tots to the Dutch oven and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.*</li>
            </ol>
