        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <p>
            <div> Disclaimer: This recipe is very freeform and as such the ingredients will not have measurements, but I would recommend keeping track of the amount of eggs, oil, and soy sauce used.</div>
            <ul>
                <li>White long grain rice - <i>old and cold rice help to keep it from being mushy.</i> </li>
                <li>Small white onion  </li>
                <li>Vegetables - <i>Peas and Carrots.  You can also add in other veggies such as bell pepper, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, snow peas and cabbage.</i></li>
                <li>Eggs </li>
                <li>Sesame Oil </li> 
                <li>Soy Sauce </li>
                <li> Onions - <i>Garnish with adding in sliced green onions right at the end!</i> </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3> Directions </h3>
        <p> 
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat Skillet. Turn your skillet to medium high heat and pour sesame oil into the bottom of your skillet and add the onion, peas and carrots. Fry this until they are tender. </li>
                <li>Slide the veggies to the side. Pour the beaten eggs onto the other side. Use a spatula to scramble the eggs. Mix them together with the veggies. </li>
                <li>Add the rice. Combine it with the veggie and egg mixture. Pour the soy sauce on top and stir until it is heated throughout. Garnish with green onions. </li>
